## Question 1

**Which code snippet(s) correctly defines a function in JavaScript?**

  1. ***var helloWorld = function(name) {
  console.log('A new world awaits, ' + name);
}***

  1. function helloWorld{name} {
  console.log('A new world awaits, ' + name);
}

  1. function = var helloWorld (name) (
  console.log('A new world awaits, ' + name);
)

  1. ***function helloWorld(name) {
  console.log('A new world awaits, ' + name);
}***

## Question 2

**What's the advantage of using functions in JavaScript?**

  * Functions make the code run much faster in the CPU

  * ***Functions help us avoid repeated code.***

  * ***A well-named function communicates clearly it's purpose.***

  * Using functions ensures our code has no errors in it.

  * ***Functions make code reusable.***

  * ***Functions let us define the code once, and then run the code wherever we need it.***

  * We can't use `if` statements without functions.

## Question 3

**Which of the below is the best explanation of what a function is, in JavaScript?**

  1.  ***A reusable set of step-by-step instructions, potentially based on input, to potentially provide some output.***

  2.  A conditional set of code blocks that runs when certain logic statements evaluate to true.

  3.  All code in JavaScript is functions.

  4.  A way to programmatically access a previously assigned value.

  5.  A flow-control language construct to execute a code block a specific amount of times.
