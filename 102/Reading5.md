1. ___What is the purpose of CSS?___
   
   CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages by letting you control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser and presenting your documents to your users with whatever design and layout you like.

   _This may include:_

   * Text styling, including changing the color and size of headings and links. 

   * Creating layouts, such as grid layouts or multiple-column layouts. 

   * Special effects such as animation. 
   
1. ___What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?___
   
   **Three ways that CSS can be inserted into your project to modify the look and feel are:**

   * _External CSS_ - Can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension; should not contain any HTML tags.

   * _Internal CSS_ - Is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section; may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

   * _Inline CSS_ - May be used to apply a unique style for a single element; add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any    CSS property.
