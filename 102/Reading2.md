The four important features to look for in a text editor are:

1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
   
4. a variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
   
6. The ability to choose from a vast selection of extensions when you need them

 

What do the following commands do? 

pwd – Stands for Print Working Directory. It tells you what the current or present working directory is that you are in. Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently. 

 

ls - Stands for list. Provides a listing of our current location. List the contents of a directory. 

 

cd- stands for change directory. Change Directories - ie. move to another directory. 

 

mkdir- a command-line instruction used to create new directories (folders) in a file system 

 

Touch- a utility primarily used for two main purposes, creating empty files & updating file timestamps. 

 

Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.) 

cd projects- Navigate the file system and move your current working directory to the “projects” location.   

 

mkdir new-project- Creates a new directory named "new-project"
