What's the difference between fuel grades at the gas station?

Great question—this is something a lot of drivers wonder about.

Short answer: Fuel grades mainly differ in octane rating, which measures resistance to engine knock. Higher octane doesn’t mean “more power” or “better gas”; it just works better in engines designed for it.

Here’s a clear breakdown:

🔹 1. What the fuel grades mean

Most U.S. stations offer:

Regular – usually 87 octane

Mid-grade – usually 88–90 octane

Premium – usually 91–93 octane

The number is the octane rating, which tells how well the fuel resists early, uncontrolled combustion (“knocking” or “pinging”).

🔹 2. What octane actually does

Inside an engine, air and fuel are compressed before being ignited. Higher compression = more efficiency and power — but it also raises the risk of knock.

Low-octane fuel ignites more easily under pressure

High-octane fuel resists igniting until the spark plug fires

So:

Engines designed for high compression/turbo/superchargers need premium

Regular engines run perfectly on regular

Using the right grade prevents engine knock and protects performance.

🔹 3. Do you get more power with premium?

📌 Only if your car is built for it.

If your owner’s manual says premium required → use premium

If it says premium recommended → premium may give smoother performance or slightly better mileage

If it says regular is fine → you won’t gain power or mpg with premium

Premium does not contain “extra detergents” compared to regular of the same brand; all grades already include required additives.

🔹 4. Can premium clean your engine?

Not really as a “cleaner.”
What matters more is:

Top Tier™ detergent levels (brand-specific, not octane-specific)

Regular maintenance

Premium isn’t a “medicine” for engines that don’t require it.

🔹 5. What happens if you use the wrong fuel?

High-octane in regular car: no harm, usually no benefit

Regular in premium-required car: possible knocking, reduced performance, long-term engine stress (in newer cars, computers often adjust, but it’s still not ideal)

🔹 6. What about diesel?

That’s a different fuel entirely:

Diesel engines ignite fuel by compression alone

Never mix gasoline and diesel — this can cause serious damage

✔️ Bottom line

Use what your owner’s manual specifies:

“Required” → always follow it

“Recommended” → optional benefit

No note → regular is fine
