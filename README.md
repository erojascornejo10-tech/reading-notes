1. **What is a Markdown?**

   -Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext documents (https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). For example, if one would like to make a certain phrase in the document bold, then the user would add two asterisks before and after the phrase in order to format it into bold letters.

1. **Why do we use Markdown?**

   -People use Markdown due to its versatility and ability to create documents, websites, books, notes, email messages, technical documentation and presentations. Markdown is an independent platform that can operate on any running device and is used everywhere, from web-based applications, to websites like GitHub and Reddit. Markdown is also portable and can be imported into another Markdown application with ease and future proof as Markdown will always be able to be read using current and future text editing applications.
